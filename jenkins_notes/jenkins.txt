Manage jenkins----global tool configuration

Job management:
--------------
Q)what is job?
  job means task. to build ,integration ,delivery these kind of tasks we can handle in jenkins job management.

 job is a core part of the jenkins.job will pull the code from scm server.build the application if successfully build delivery the code.

There are different types of jobs:
----------------------------------
1)free style
   we can integrate any fype of files.
2)maven job
   we can integrate only java files
3)pipeline jobs
  sequence of jobs, one job is connected to anothr job.
4)multipipe line jobs

Q)how to schedule a job in jenkins?
 - get the code from scm server (gitbucket)
 - setting trigger (build process trigger)
 - setup build environment 
 - build acion
 - post build action


build maven Job in jenkins:
---------------------------

code compile:
code test:
code integration:
code package:

for job pipeline install the "build pipeline plugin"

here trigger the job as build after other job.

deploy:
-------
for deploy the code into tomcat install "deploy to container plugin"

at post build action setup the "deploy war/ear to container"

backup:
-------
for jenkins server backup install "backup plugin"


email notification in jenkins:
-----------------------------
install the plugin "email extension plugin", "email extension template plugin"

configure mailserver,port,smtp authentication in "system configure"

User management:
---------------


1)install necessary plugin
  role based authorization strategy	

2)create users
	Manage jenkins ---> Manage users --> create users
	dev_user
	test_user
	manager

3)create roles
	developer
	tester
 for this you need to enable "role based strategy" in "configure global security"

4)create roles and assign users to the roles
  	Manage jenkins ---> Manage & assign roles 

 i)
  global roles and 	project roles
     |			    |
   job_creator          java,php,maven.

  ii)
              global roles		
              admin    job_creator
   dev_user 
   test_user
   manager
  
  iii)      project roles
              java      php     maven
   dev_user  
   tset_user
   manager


Jenkins Cli:
-----------
 we can access jenkins from cli
1)download the jenkins-cli.war and run it

2)in security management enable "cli over remoting"

3)assign annonymous to admin role

 - java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192.168.43.183:8080/jenkins/ help

then run the commands it is unsecure procedure we can ssh instead of this .

1)ssh plugin is required.
2)create public and private key of the system user.
3)place public key of user in admin user configuration section.
4)ensble ssh in configure global security.
 
 - ssh -l (user name) -p 2020 localhost version

set up slave in jenkins:
-----------------------
1)manage jenkins --> Manage nodes
2)add node
3)set up node
	name:new_node
doc_directory:/home/krishna/
 Launch method	:via ssh
	host:(ip)
	credentials:
host verification: known host verification
	from jenkins master cmd "ssh <node ip>"
